// // The console logs will appear in this order:
// 1. '1' - runs first as it's in the main synchronous execution context
// 2. '4' - runs second as it's also in the main synchronous execution context
// 3. '3' - runs third because Promises are microtasks and have priority over macrotasks (setTimeout)
// 4. '2' - runs last because setTimeout is a macrotask and goes to the callback queue

// This happens because of JavaScript's Event Loop and its execution order:
// 1. First, synchronous code in the main thread is executed (that's why 1 and 4 appear first)
// 2. Then microtasks queue is processed (Promise callbacks are microtasks)
// 3. Finally, macrotasks queue is processed (setTimeout callbacks are macrotasks)

// Even though setTimeout has 0ms delay, it still gets pushed to the callback queue
// and waits for both the main thread to finish and all microtasks to be processed
